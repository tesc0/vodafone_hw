# Vodafone homework

Used frameworks: 
Symfony, VueJS and Bootstrap.

Used the default settings, the symfony server was launched by the simple "symfony server:start" command on the command line interface (windows powershell for me). After that the project is running on "https://localhost:8000".

The database is included with preloaded data.
